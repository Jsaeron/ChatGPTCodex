This repository contains a simple Python script to demonstrate a greeting
function. You can run the script directly or run the tests with `pytest`.

## Running the script

```bash
python greet.py Alice
```

This will output:

```
Hello, Alice!
```

If no name is provided, it defaults to `World`.

## Running tests

Install `pytest` if you haven't already and run:

```bash
pytest
```
